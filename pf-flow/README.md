# PF Flow

A real-time, offline-capable flowing app for Public Forum debate, built for two partners who share one flow.
Cell editing and keyboard navigation follow [Flower](https://debate-flow.vercel.app/).

## Architecture

| Piece | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App | Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind, static SPA | No server code. Fully offline-capable as a PWA (a service worker caches the app shell, so reloading offline works). |
| Data model | [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) CRDT, one `Y.Doc` per flow/template plus one per-room index doc | Concurrent edits merge character by character; nothing is overwritten. |
| Offline | `y-indexeddb` (every change is saved locally right away) plus a localStorage stash on page unload | Works with no Wi-Fi. Changes merge automatically when the connection comes back. |
| Live sync | Supabase Realtime **broadcast** (Yjs updates, cursors) plus **presence** (who's here) | Typical latency is about 60–100 ms. |
| Durable storage | Supabase Postgres append-only update log, compacted automatically | A new device or partner loads the full flow even when nobody else is online. |
| Access control | No auth. Tables have RLS on and **no policies**. All access goes through `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs that require the 8-character room code (31-symbol alphabet, ~8.5×10¹¹ codes). | You can't list rooms; you need the code. |

Why not Next.js? Nothing here needs server rendering. A static SPA with a service worker gives much more reliable offline reloads.

If `VITE_SUPABASE_*` env vars are missing, the app falls back to a **local mode**: it syncs between tabs of one browser through BroadcastChannel. This is handy for development.

## Run locally

```bash
cd pf-flow
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in your Supabase URL + publishable key
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5173
```

The service worker (offline reload) only runs in a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm run preview              # http://localhost:4173
```

## Setup steps you do by hand

1. **Supabase.** A free-tier project named `pf-flow` (ref `mlfarkjibpcnxcfozbly`) has already been created in your FirstDibs org, and `supabase/schema.sql` has been applied to it.
   * To use a different project, open its SQL Editor and run `supabase/schema.sql`. Then copy *Project URL* and the *publishable* (or legacy anon) key from **Settings → API**.
   * Free projects pause after about a week of inactivity. Un-pause from the Supabase dashboard if the app shows "Connecting…" forever.
2. **Vercel.** Import the GitHub repo and set:
   * **Root Directory:** `pf-flow`
   * Framework preset: Vite (build `npm run build`, output `dist`). `vercel.json` already handles SPA routing.
   * Environment variables (Production + Preview):
     * `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://mlfarkjibpcnxcfozbly.supabase.co`
     * `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable key from Supabase → Settings → API>`
3. Open the site, click **Create a room**, and send the 8-character code to your partner. Both of you are rejoined to that room automatically next time.

## Using it

* **Rooms:** one room holds your team's flows and templates. The code is in the top bar (click to copy). **Leave** goes back to the join screen.
* **Flows:** each flow has Aff and Con tabs. Add more with **+** (Weighing, Offs, Overview, Notes, or a custom name). Double-click a tab to rename it. Drag tabs to reorder. Use the tab's ⋯ menu to move, delete, or show and hide columns on extra tabs.
* **Modes:** "Aff speaks first" or "Con speaks first" is chosen when you create a flow and can be switched in the header.
  * First team's sheet: Const → opp. Rebuttal → Summaries → Final Focuses (6 columns).
  * Second team's sheet: Const → both Rebuttals → Summaries → Final Focuses (7 columns).
  * Extra tabs: all 8 speeches in speaking order. No crossfire columns.
  * Switching mode keeps every cell in its column position. If a sheet loses a column, cells in it are hidden (not deleted) until you switch back, and you're warned first.
* **Cells** work like Flower. A cell's responses sit in the next column on the same row, so a whole argument chain lines up horizontally.
* **Marks:** dropped (red, struck through), extended (green), and turned (purple). Use Alt+1/2/3, or right-click a cell.
* **Templates:** build one in the Templates tab, or click **Save as template** in any flow. Start a flow from a template in the New flow dialog or with a template's **New flow from this** button. The copy is independent of the template. A template used in the other mode keeps column positions, so constructives stay in column 1.
* **Timers:** these sit in the bottom bar and are synced through the flow, using a server-calibrated clock. They cover every PF speech and crossfire, plus Aff and Con prep. Default lengths are 4/4/3/2 minutes for speeches, 3:00 for crossfires, and 3:00 prep. Change lengths in Settings; the lengths are shared by the room. When time runs out the bar flashes, and there's an optional beep (speaker icon).
* **Settings** (gear icon): your name and cursor color, theme (system/light/dark), cell font size (12–20 px), reset column widths (drag a column header's right edge to resize), timer sound, and timer lengths.

## Keyboard shortcuts

`Mod` = ⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere. `Alt` = ⌥ on macOS. Press **Mod + /** for this list in the app.

**Navigate** (a cell is focused)

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ↑ / ↓ | Cell above / below in the same column (crosses argument boundaries) |
| ← | Parent (the argument this responds to) |
| → | First response in the next column |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Next / previous sibling |
| Esc | Leave the cell |
| ↑ ↓ ← → or ↵ (no cell focused) | Jump back into the flow |

**Create**

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| ↵ | Go to the next sibling, or create a new cell below if there is none |
| Shift+↵ | Add a response (next column) |
| Mod+↵ | Insert a new cell directly below |
| Mod+Shift+↵ | Insert a new cell directly above |
| Alt+↵ | Go to the previous sibling, or create a new cell above if there is none |
| Alt+Shift+↵ | Respond to the next argument |
| Mod+E | Extend: carry the argument into the next column with an → cell |
| Click a line between cells | Insert there |
| **+** on a column header | Start a new argument in that column |

**Edit and mark**

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Alt+1 / Alt+2 / Alt+3 | Mark dropped / extended / turned (press again to clear) |
| Alt+0 | Clear mark |
| Right-click | Cell menu |
| Mod+B | Bold |
| Mod+Shift+X | Cross out |
| Backspace (empty cell) | Delete the cell |
| Mod+Backspace | Delete the cell and its responses |
| Mod+Z / Mod+Shift+Z | Undo / redo (undoes only your own edits) |

**Tabs and timers**

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Mod+Alt+↑ / ↓ | Previous / next tab |
| Alt+S | Start / pause the speech timer |
| Alt+N / Alt+P | Next / previous speech |
| Alt+R | Reset the speech timer |
| Alt+A / Alt+C | Start / pause Aff / Con prep |

## Choices where the spec and Flower differ

* **Grid model:** Flower uses a tree, not a fixed spreadsheet: each response is a child of the cell it answers. That is what keeps responses on the same row as their argument, so this app does the same. Multiple responses to one argument stack inside that argument's row.
* **Arrow keys always navigate between cells, as in Flower.** To move the caret inside a cell's text, use the mouse, Home/End, or Alt/Mod+arrows.
* **Shift+↵ appends** the new response after any existing responses. Flower inserts it first. Appending reads more naturally when you add a second response.
* **Flower's settings for Enter behavior** aren't exposed. Instead there are dedicated "always insert" shortcuts: Mod+↵ and Mod+Shift+↵.
* **Bold, cross-out, and the Mod+E extension cell** come from Flower. The dropped/extended/turned marks are separate from these.
* **Undo** works only on your own edits, so you never undo your partner's work.
